# SY402-Lab-8
Code for Amy, Ritchi, Molly, and Margaret

The files in this repository are for Amy, Ritchi, Molly, and Margaret, aka the Super Group.

In order to recursively search through a directory, we obtained code from https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_traversing_directory_tree_recursively_os_walk.php.

In order to figure out how to add to a repository from the command line, we used the instructions on https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line.

Uploading the reposiorty to my desktop was done using the instructions provided by the GitHub welcome page (no link availble for this)

All participants contribted equally to the project and completing the project with the Super Group ended up being really fun.

Note: Data from the hashed file was hashed using SHA256 and was stored in a list.
